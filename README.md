# Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification

This project involves classifying sonar signals as either bouncing off a **rock** or a **mine** using machine learning techniques.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Shape**: 208 samples × 61 columns
- **Features**:
  - 60 numeric attributes representing sonar energy readings
  - 1 target label: `'R'` (rock) or `'M'` (mine)

## 📌 Objective

To build and evaluate a machine learning model that can accurately classify the sonar returns using the provided features.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy,  Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook or VSCode
- ML Model: Logistic Regression.

## 🚀 Steps

1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Encode the target labels
3. Split the data into train/test sets
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics accuracy score

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Model performance will be assessed using:
- Accuracy Score
